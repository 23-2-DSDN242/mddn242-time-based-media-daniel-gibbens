## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

**Part 1:**
For my part 1 sketch I played around with the idea of a solar eclipse, with 24 different eclipse states (phases) to represent hours. To represent minutes and seconds I have red and white orbiting moons respectively. I also added some numbers like an analog clock however these go to 60 to help with visual clarity. I like the idea of vibrant colours on a dark background to draw the eye.

**Part 2:**
The Maeda clock I have chosen to recreate is clock-04. I was able to successfully recreate the shearing effect after a level of great difficulty. I decided to use less squares to represent a number as it was easier to conceptualise and implement. I experimented with having the time animate in many directions but decided on two up and two down to fill the screen with past numbers as I find this visually intriguing.

**Part 3:**
The original clock I designed is a space ship shooting game theme.
At the top right, there are several hearts displayed using 12-hour time format. At the last second of each hour, a new heart appears and expands. In the bottom left, there is an overheating bar that changes color from green to lime, then yellow/orange, and finally red throughout the minute. During the last third of the minute, the screen flashes using millis. Additionally, the green spaceship fires bullets every second and half a second, and the bars on the bottom right indicate the time remaining until the next shot. The background continuously scrolls to create movement in the scene. The number of red spaceships corresponds to the current minute, with a new spaceship entering from the top center just before the minute changes, and all the spaceships disperse into an arc shape offscreen when the hour changes. Lastly, the spaceships move in a lemniscate (infinity) path, symbolizing the infinite nature of time.
