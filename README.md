## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

**Part 1:**
For my part 1 sketch I played around with the idea of a solar eclipse, with 24 different eclipse states (phases) to represent hours. To represent minutes and seconds I have red and white orbiting moons respectively. I also added some numbers like an analog clock however these go to 60 to help with visual clarity. I like the idea of vibrant colours on a dark background to draw the eye.

**Part 2:**
The Maeda clock I have chosen to recreate is clock-04. I was able to successfully recreate the shearing effect after a level of great difficulty. I decided to use less squares to represent a number as it was easier to conceptualise and implement. I experimented with having the time animate in many directions but decided on two up and two down to fill the screen with past numbers as I find this visually intriguing.
